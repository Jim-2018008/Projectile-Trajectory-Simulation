# Projectile-Trajectory-Simulation

This repository contains a Simulink model simulating the trajectory of a projectile with and without air resistance. The simulation considers a 5 kg projectile launched at 100 m/s and 45° to the horizontal, using a drag force based on the coefficient of drag Cd​, air density 𝜌, and velocity 𝑣. This comparative analysis provides insight into how air resistance affects the range, maximum height, and time of flight for the projectile.
